# Project Name

Earbuds Page

## Description

For this project, we have been tasked with making a promotional web page for earbuds that we modelled and rendered in Cinema 4D, apart from the modelling and rendering we also had to use different methods to make the page "come alive", such as greensock scripts to help animate ScroolTo functions, and also code an X-Ray slider which would portray an X-Ray of the earbuds, and also a 450 frame animation that would be showcased throughout the webpage simply by scrolling up or down.
